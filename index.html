      <p class="phrase">Reality is merely an illusion, <br>albeit a very persistent one.<br> – Albert Einstein</p>
      
      <p class="text">Throughout human history, the question of reality was one of the most fundamental in philosophy and metaphysics because it was directly connected to the understanding of our nature and existence. Reality is a mystery that cannot be exactly described or measured. As far as human being experiences only his own mind which encapsulates all thoughts, feelings and individual’s experience, our understanding of reality turns to be very personal and subjective. Nevertheless, when the question “What is real?” appears, we address it to the physical world where our body functions, breathes and navigates. From there on we believe more in a socially shared physicality, which can be viewable, hearable, touchable, lickable, smellable and in total also experienceable by someone else. The world of thoughts, ideas, fantasies and imagination is being considered as ephemeral and ‘unreal’. This approach created a gap between mind and body, material and spiritual.
      </p>
      
      <p class="text">With the rise of Digital Revolution, appearing of new technologies, ways of communication and creation, the understanding of reality got extended and became even more confusing. It is clear that the creation of virtual space was a reflection on the social reality of modern society, in particular, the reality with a lack of “community”, “experiencing unity”, “interactivity”, “self-realization” and so on. Virtual world appeared being a space for the compensation of communicative and festive reality. We already live a considerable amount of our lives online, where we interact with people, deal in goods and services, work and entertain ourselves virtually. It is impossible to deny the fact that the two worlds of physicality and virtuality seem to have a huge influence on each other. 
      </p>
      
      <p class="phrase">We live in a dualistic society with a dualistic language and dualistic concept structure: Either-Or. Virtual reality is Both-And. We still have a physical body in VR. In other words, when I put on the headphones I can still eat, I can be both physical and virtual. This is actually very close to the alchemist creed "As above, so below." It's also very close to the fundamental operator in the logic of implication "If on the outside, then on the inside. " That is, environments have rules of containers rather than rules of symbols. The environment surrounds and we can point to the inside of what surrounds as something that is inside. But you'll notice that space pervades. When I make a container, I have done nothing to the space on the outside or the space on the inside, except to distinguish the space on the inside as special. I have not carved space, I have not made it dual. I have made it pervasive.
        <a class="footnote">1</a></p>

      <p class="text">From now one we see an obvious transformation and blurring the edges between virtual and physical, which supports the ideas and theories of monists, saying that we live in a technological-centered hybrid environment forming a continuous and single substance which we call “reality”.</p>

      <p class="text">Every technology is the ideological investment of society in its own near future. The invention of virtual reality mechanism belongs to the the achievements of applied science which is associated with changes in many areas of human activity, especially in the mass consciousness. It has a great power to invade the most intimate spheres of our lives, changing the way we live and think. Virtual reality strongly proposes to formulate the eternal questions again. What is reality? How do we experience it? How does the world around us relate to our feelings and ideas? Where is the boundary between culture and nature, artificial and natural? While exploring it we not only touch upon the problems of being, but learn ourselves from the beginning — our body, mind, and feelings from a different perspective.
      </p>
      
      <p class="text">Although virtual reality considered being a relatively new technology, it originates from a stereoscopic photography, inventions like Sensorama and the Telesphere Mask made by Morton Heilig, a head-mounted device by Ivan Sutherland called “the Ultimate Display” in 60’s, and the Virtual Interface Environment Workstation (VIEW) system by NASA in the mid 80’s. However, the term itself was first proposed by Jaron Lanier, founder of VPL Research, who began to develop the gear (including goggles and gloves) needed to experience the “virtual reality.” The idea of it as a technology, became a transformation of a screen, as a barrier between virtual distant world and user, into the next level of the natural interaction with and among users, objects, and environments of shared 3D space.
      </p>
      
      <p class="phrase">We’re finally going to be free of the 2D monitor. It’s been a window into virtual reality that we’ve all looked into for 30–40 years. <a class="footnote">2</a>
